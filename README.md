## About The Project
In this project I am tasked with refactoring the code for a client that would like to make their website more accessible for people with disabilities. Web accessibility is an increasingly important attribute to businesses that want to be inclusive in their target audience. Accessibility is a broad subject and pertains many things, however, my tech lead has given me a few criteria to satisfy a portion of the project.
