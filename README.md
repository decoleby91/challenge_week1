In this project I'll be working on a client's website in order to optimize it's content for current accessibility standards in order to optimize the site for search engines
The website must meet certain accessibility standards in order to meet the client's aspirations for their audience
In my role I'll need to complete the following:
*Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
